```haskell
import Data.Monoid (Monoid, mconcat)

-- Example Product type with Monoid instance
newtype Product = Product { getProduct :: Int }
  deriving (Show, Eq)

instance Semigroup Product where
  Product x <> Product y = Product (x * y)

instance Monoid Product where
  mempty = Product 1

-- Function to multiply a list of Product values using mconcat
multiplyProducts :: [Product] -> Product
multiplyProducts = mconcat

-- Example usage
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let products = [Product 2, Product 3, Product 4]
  print $ multiplyProducts products  -- Output: Product {getProduct = 24}
```
