🚀 Project Catalyst: Global University Onboarding Initiative  
by Tobb Technologies | In collaboration with Cardano

👩🏽‍💻 *Hi, I am Sibongile, a student at Tobb Technologies Organization. I am proud to be part of this incredible journey under Project Catalyst to onboard the next generation of Web3 developers through Cardano Smart Contract education and innovation.*

---

🧭 A. Introduction

We are currently running a global onboarding project approved under **Project Catalyst** — the world’s largest decentralized innovation engine on **Cardano**.

This initiative is onboarding **16 universities globally**, offering students a chance to become pioneers in blockchain and smart contract development. We aim to empower young minds through hands-on learning, collaboration, and real-world decentralized applications.

---

🎯 B. Aim

To **grow the Cardano developer ecosystem** and **upskill university/college students** in **Web3 and Cardano Smart Contract development** using Haskell and Plutus.

---

🎓 C. Objectives

- 🪙 Create blockchain assets (Fungible Tokens & NFTs)
- 💡 Build on-chain Smart Contracts with **Haskell & Plutus**
- 🌐 Learn about Cardano's key technologies: **CIP-1694, Midnight, Hydra**
- 🧠 Strengthen **problem-solving** & **functional programming** skills
- 🤝 Collaborate via the **Intersect MBO Developer Advocate Program**
- 💻 Contribute to **Cardano Intersect GitHub** (forks, PRs, commits)
- 📣 Promote Cardano products from: IOG, Emurgo, Intersect, Stake Pools, Gimbalabs, and more
