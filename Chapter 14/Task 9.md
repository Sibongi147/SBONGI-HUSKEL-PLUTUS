module Main where

-- Function with a partial type signature using wildcard
exampleFunction :: _ => [Int] -> Int
exampleFunction xs = sum (take 3 xs)

main :: IO ()

### âœ… Notes:

* `{-# LANGUAGE PartialTypeSignatures #-}` enables partial (wildcard) type signatures.
* The `_ =>` wildcard allows GHC to infer the necessary constraints (like `Num Int` in this case).
* This is useful for experimenting or for simplifying type annotations while developing.
